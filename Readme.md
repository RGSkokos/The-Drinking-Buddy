# Objective
The objective of this project is to build hardware and link it to an android application while using the Agile project methodologies. 
# Description
Our product, in summary, is a personalized handheld breathalyzer you can carry with you anywhere you go. It is connected to an android application you can download for free, however, to register your account, you must purchase the device and register the serial code. Once that is done, you will be prompted to create a user profile so that the device analytics can better analyze your information upon use. The purpose of the device is to measure your alcohol intake and visually display your results, how your results correlate to statistics, your stats over time/prolonged use and it is entirely customized to your profile (based on age, gender, weight, and height). This information is never shared outside of your personal device but does not share any responsibility if misused.
